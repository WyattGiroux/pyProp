====================
pyProp Documentation
====================

``pyProp`` is a open-source equivalent to the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation 
(`NPSS <https://www.swri.org/markets/electronics-automation/software/aerospace-software/numerical-propulsion-system-simulation-npss>`_) 
maintained and developed by the Southwest Research Institute. It aims to provide a similar component-based method for sizing and running
aircraft propulsion systems at both on- and off-design conditions.


===============
Getting Started
===============
As ``pyProp`` is currently unreleased, there is no method to get started.


============
Unit Systems
============
``pyProp`` currently only supports standard SI units.
